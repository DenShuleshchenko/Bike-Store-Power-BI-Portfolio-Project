# Bike-Store-Power-BI-Portfolio-Project

This is my Power BI portfolio project. It is a logical continuation of the project "Bike-Store-SQL-Portfolio-Project". In this project, I visualized the relevant results of previous studies using bar, line and pie charts. I have also made my dashboard as clean as possible, so that anyone could read and understand it very easily.

There are nine files with data in it: "brands"(product brands), "categories"(product categories), "customers"(first and last names, email, address), "order_items"(list price, discount and quantity of ordered products), "orders"(order date, delivery date, order status), "products"(product name, model year and list price), "staff"(first and last names, email, phone), "stocks"(quantity of products), "stores"(name, email, phone, address). Also there is file with photo of the dashboard.
